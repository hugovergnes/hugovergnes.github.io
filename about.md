## Professional Background
---

As a **Research Scientist** based in San Mateo, California, I bring over **4 years of experience** specializing in **backend development** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Currently, I am actively involved in pioneering **autonomous cancer screening technology**, where my focus is on developing innovative AI solutions that directly impact healthcare.

My journey in AI began with a strong foundation in **Applied Mathematics** and **Artificial Intelligence** during my studies at **École Polytechnique**. This was further solidified through my **Master’s in Statistics** at **Stanford University**, where I applied theoretical knowledge to real-world problems in the healthcare sector.

### Major Projects:
- **Enhancing Mammogram Image Quality**: Developed a solution that outperformed expert human radiologists (15 years of experience) in both sensitivity and specificity, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy for patients.

- **Advancing Autonomous Cancer Detection**: Contributed to a system that maintains an exceptional sensitivity rate of **99%** while automating the analysis of negative cases across diverse demographics, including variations in race, age, localization, and breast density.

## Values & Motivation
---

Do one thing and do it well.

In the recent development of AI in the recent years I've seen more and more complexe form of intelligence emerging. And yet most of them can't seem to do any useful. I believe that this contradiction lies in the race to AGI.
I think the most useful tools will be the specific one (Github Copilot for example), that focus on doing one thing and do it well.
